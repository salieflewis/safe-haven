# safe-haven

Safe haven builds upon the existing plugin ecosystem of Safes. By integrating the allowlist plugin into your Safe, the owner gains the capability to execute transactions to allowlisted accounts. The inspiration for this project was to design a frontend that seamlessly incorporates the allowlist plugin, facilitating arbitrary functions to be executed within the Safe's context.
